👋 Hey there! I’m Adarsh, a passionate Red Hat OpenShift administrator with a penchant for all things DevOps. 🚀

As someone who thrives on orchestrating containers, automating workflows, and ensuring seamless deployments, I’ve found my sweet spot in the intersection of operations and development. 🛠️

🌟 Here’s what you’ll find in my toolkit:

OpenShift Magic: I wield the power of Kubernetes with the elegance of a kungFu Master. Helm charts? Custom Operators? Bring it on!
CI/CD Maestro: Git hooks, Jenkins pipelines, and GitHub Actions—I choreograph these like a conductor leading a symphony.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform, Ansible, and a dash of YAML—because why manually configure when you can script it?
Monitoring & Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, and a hawk-eye for anomalies. I like my metrics like I like my coffee—fresh and abundant. ☕
🔭 Currently, I’m exploring DevOps because curiosity is my compass. 🌐

When I’m not wrangling YAML or debugging Helm charts, you’ll find me hiking in the digital wilderness, chasing down elusive bugs like a code detective. 🕵️‍♂️

📬 Let’s connect! Whether it’s discussing the latest DevOps trends or swapping containerization war stories, drop me a line. 📩

Remember: git commit -m "Life is too short for manual deployments"—because ain’t nobody got time for that! 😎
